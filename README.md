# payee-project

### Technical Test
As you know, we make payments on behalf of our clients. We like to be able to display the payment details in a clear, concise manner for our employees, who are responsible for ensuring the vendors receive the payments.

Attached is a blob of json data that represents the following: There are multiple vendors ("Payee") who will be paid using payment cards ("Payment"), with the associated invoices attached to each payment ("Remittance").

There is only one requirement - create a webpage that shows each Payee/Payment/Remittance object in a paged interface. Everything else is up to you - overall design, technology used, styling, amount of time spent on the test, etc.

Upload your sample to a private Github account or email to hr@paymerang.com
